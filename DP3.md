## Problem Statement
In real-time online lectures, being late or losing track of the content **heavily penalizes the listener in comparison to physical lectures**, leaving large gaps of information and **reducing comprehension going forward**. 


## Tasks

 1. **Use the flag button** to generate the lecture timeline, twice.
 2. **Post a question** using the “Notice” flag, and check your answer later and resolve it.
 3. **Answer the question** in the “Chapter” flag and questions assigned to you via MinChat.

### Prototyping Tool: **Figma**

We chose Figma for prototyping. Figma is a web-based prototyping tool that does not require any installation and is thus quick and easy to start (which complies with the core value of “low-fi” prototyping). Also, being web-based makes our prototype much easier to share among our group members and users. While we managed to physically meet most of our users, we had to be prepared for an online user testing due to the pandemic. AdobeXD was another option that we considered, but previous experience with AdobeXD taught us that it can get really slow for large files and sub-optimal computers, on top of losing the benefits of an URL based tool.

The sharing part went well with Figma as we expected. We experienced no lagging and could synchronously work on the prototype along with Zoom. Figma supports viewing multiple frames on a single window, so we can easily organize our user workflow and design with consistency. Also, we can simply drag a line from an object to a frame to make a transition, which was absolutely necessary for building a multi-frame prototype.

Figma was a great tool, but still not perfect. It would have been useful if there was a chat function associated with it, which could have saved our effort having to move back and forth between other messenger apps (when we did not use Zoom) and Figma.

### Omitted Design Choices

**Thumbnail on Hovering Over Timeline** Like on YouTube, users can hover on the timeline of the lecture to view a small thumbnail screen. We only implemented this feature for few segments of the timeline, as we thought it was necessary to show the existence of the feature as most users will be already familiar with the feature.

**Time that Actually Ticks** Our system is for real-time lectures, meaning that there will have to be certain events that are dependent on time. These include each section flag being finalized through aggregating many users’ inputs (Task 1), section flag moving toward the left as time advances (Task 1), user being notified for their question being answered (Task 2), question occasionally arriving to the user (Task 4), and so on. It was difficult to implement an actual "time" in Figma, and it was unnecessary to make the user actually wait for that time. We implemented the prototype so that if the user clicks on the time at the right end of the timeline, it will show the view at the time where the next event happens. As we did not implement time, all algorithms that work with time were not implemented.

### Representative Screenshots

### Instructions
The [following](https://www.figma.com/proto/JHYZayKschscpM5sQty0GX/CS473-DP3-Low-fi?node-id=133:643&scaling=min-zoom) is a low-fi prototype of a system that supports distracted users in online lectures to quickly catch up with the context. The system is composed of four features: (1) the main lecture screen where the real-time lecture is being held, (2) the lecture timeline generated by the listeners, (3) MinChat (the chatroom), and (4) the Catch Up mode where listeners ask and answer questions.

If you click on any part of the screen, the clickable parts of the prototype will be highlighted. Please use the highlighted parts to complete the three tasks described above.

Due to the limitations of the low-fi prototype, we simulated the passage of time by pressing the timer on the lecture timeline. Also, you can always click on the Minchoom logo on the left top to restart the task. The text inputs are hard coded as well.

For the “answer the questions assigned to you via MinChat” part in task 3, please click on the main lecture screen to begin, in order to simulate a random time of the lecture. After you finish each task, click the Minchoom logo to start a new task.

## Observations
### Participants
-----

**P1**: KAIST undergraduate *(3rd year, M, Dept. of Bio & Brain Engineering)* 

> Does not normally miss classes, but worry that he may have
> missed/misunderstood lecture contents.

**P2**: KAIST undergraduate *(4th year, F, Dept. of Mathematics)* 

> Does not normally miss classes, but worry about missing parts of
> lecture due to unstable internet.

**P3**: KAIST undergraduate *(3rd year, F, Dept. of Materials Science)*  

> Typically does not miss classes (once or twice a month).

**P4**: KAIST undergraduate *(2nd year, F, School of Electrical Engineering)*  

> Taking four real-time classes; not late to classes, but often misses
> parts of the lecture.

**P5**: KAIST undergraduate *(4th year, M, School of Computing)*

> Misses classes very frequently (30% of the time)

### Usability Problems
-----
#### Confusion from the UI

 1. **Was confused on which flags direct to which content (P1)**
 <b> *Overall Criticality*: High
 <b> *Solution*: Full implementation of thumbnails-on-hover will help the user know which content each flag leads to.

 2.  **Worried that as time passes, the flags will clump together and be hard to distinguish (P1)**
    *Overall Criticality*: High
    *Solution*: Color-code the flags to make it more easily distinguishable by content

 3.  **Was unable to distinguish between the chatroom and the Catch Up Mode (P4, P5)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Medium
    *Solution*: Have separate sections for the two chats or have tabs to switch between the two modes.

 4.  **Did not like how the mic/camera/flag buttons were covering parts of the screen (P4)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Low
    *Solution*: Move the taskbar below or above the video to not cover the screen

 5.  **Thought flags would be draggable and be able to be placed anywhere on the timeline (P3)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Low
    *Solution*: Make the flags look more like clickable buttons and make sure they don’t look draggable to the timeline.

 6.  **Was confused whether dragging on the lecture timeline shows the video clip or the screenshot of the lecture material (P4)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Low
    *Solution*: On actual lecture, the screen will only show the lecture material (shown by screen-share in Zoom).
    
#### Unclear System Operations

 7.  **Did not understand how assigned question works (P1)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Medium
    *Solution:* Add additional explanations on the question. For example, “Someone in the class has asked, ‘what was the notice about?’” Also, provide an information button that says “Why do I see this?” on hover, and shows how the assignment works on click.

 8.  **Did not understand how the flags were going to get aggregated (P3)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Medium
    *Solution*: Explain briefly on how aggregation works and show examples.

 9.  **Did not understand the function of Upvote/Downvote (P4)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Low
    Solution: Explain how upvote works as a sign of agreement. Remove the downvote function to simplify the system.

#### Distraction

10.  **Distracted by the notification of assigned question (P1)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Medium
    *Solution*: Find the right timing to send out the notifications.

11.  **Mentally bothered by the numbers(questions) marked on the flag (P1, P5)**
    *Overall Criticality*: Medium
    *Solution*: Allow users to set the setting of whether to show the numbers.

#### Unclear Purported User

12.  **Thought that the questions are only to be answered by the lecturer at first (P1)**
    *Overall Criticality*: High
    Solution: Make it clear with a simple instruction on top of chat or other visual cues (e.g. chat box flashing) to direct the questions to the user

13.  **Was confused who performed what roles (who does the flags, who upvotes, etc.) (P3, P4, P5)**
    *Overall Criticality*: High
    Solution: Seeing that the buttons responsible for the roles are all interactable on a single screen will help resolve the issue. Dividing the tasks into separate workflows could have resulted in such a confusion.
