## Problem statement
During online lectures/meetings, once you get distracted from the lectures/meetings due to external factors (e.g. being late, spacing out, answering a phone call), it is difficult to get back on track.

## Problem background


## Motivation

## HMW questions
* HMW ensures that this summary does not lead to frustrating or follow-up questions?
* HMW prevent malicious trolling or mistakes from decreasing the quality?
* HMW keep the resultant supplementary material in adequate level of detail?
* HMW make people not join late? 
* HMW make this useful to people who weren't late and even when the class has ended?
* HMW keep the context shared alongside the lectures/meetings?
* HMW keep a similar structure across different lectures?
* HMW incorporate different media (pictures, videos, demos, verbal) into the summaries?
* HMW allow communication between the listeners?
* HMW make the professor/meeting host share the context with latecomers?
* HMW use this for attendance checks or participation scores?
* HMW incentivize users to participate in ‘summary-crowdsourcing’?
* HMW check and assure the user that they have understood the content, and are okay to move on?
* HMW handle if students trust the summary too much -> not watch the missed parts -> miss some info?
* HMW make sure simultaneously summarizing and listening to lectures is easy? (I.e. both screens are visible)
* HMW ensure that participating in the task does not deter from understanding the content? 
* HMW handle if students came too late? (should length of summary be proportional to the time missed?)
* HMW incorporate the lecturer into also participating in the system?
* HMW not distract listeners who are willing to give answers(summary)?
* HMW make this quick so that people don’t miss much after joining?
* HMW archive the summaries for each lecture?

## Top 3 HMW questions
* **HMW incentivize users to participate in ‘summary-crowdsourcing’?**
* **HMW keep the resultant supplementary material in adequate level of detail?**
* **HMW ensure that participating in the task does not deter from understanding the content?**

## Solution ideas for the HMW questions
### Solution ideas to *HMW incentivize users to participate in ‘summary-crowdsourcing’?*
* Not a solution but a question to ask first: do we need incentives to make people answer? Will they not do it voluntarily?
* On demand summary providing..? If HELP sign blinks, I would want to help by answering.
* Participation score - If the lecturer wants to, they can give extra credit?
* Upvotes/downvotes
* Automatic random assignment 
* Threshold system - Only after participating in a certain amount can people see the notes(summary)
* Verified/ranking system
* Reputation system - If there is a dispute, people’s votes will be ‘weighted’ by their reputation.
* Idk if this works for other people, but if the prof/host compliments me for answering the question, I would do it.
* If we make the task simple enough, at least some people will participate? Is my guess? - Random thought, but I think we should keep this simple so that only the crowd can collaboratively come up with the solution without having a moderator of some sort..
* People that participated actively in making the document got higher scores! (advertise) / more like people that will get high scores will have participated actively

### Solution ideas to *HMW keep the resultant supplementary material in adequate level of factual details?*
* Put a character limit on each point (or sentence limit!)
* Put a time limit on how much each person can contribute → also could be a solution to the third HMW
* Paraphrase function
* Length proportional to the amount of contents missed
* Organization manager and moderator
* Create a structure form - Similar language/style, also (i.e. shorthands)
* Discussion boards/communication between users
* Support Iterative Reviewing (for lectures) - Organise contents in a nested manner. Only reveal the lesser branches if the user has confirmed that they understood the parent branch.
* Show who wrote what for accountability (social translucence ← wowㅋㅋㅋㅋ)
* Very random, but build trust towards people writing the supplementary material?
* Build a search system on the summary.
* Credits for Removing Contents!

### Solution ideas to *HMW ensure that participating in the task does not deter from understanding the real-time content?*
* Split screen/modal
* Rewind feature / 배속 feature
* Maybe we don’t have to make users do multitasking - instead of parallelizing, we can give summary first and control speed(fast) until one reaches the current timestamp 
* Quick screen capture → text
* Popup screen to quickly record the contents professor mentioned in a given time
* Task can be done while the prof does not speak / answer questions
* Let the person asking the question provide as many contexts as possible - The person trying to catch up can capture the text/sentence of the moment he came in
* Question system: people can leave comments/questions for clarification
* Professors themselves can refer to the document and see how people are following up. - Asking questions mid-class really harms others’ learning experience. Leave it on the document so that it does not interfere / can be reviewed.
* Same lectures in upcoming semesters will benefit (people won’t need much effort)
* Let A.I. build a skeleton so that it is easier for people to write ヅ
* Voice recognition -> correction done manually? - Or at least the transcript can be used to minimize the effort of users typing
